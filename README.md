## What is MS-SPEAK?
MS-SPEAK(MultiSpeak Secure Protocol Enterprise Access Kit)  is a collection of software tools that allow for translating (a sub-set of) messages between versions 3, 4 and 5 of the MultiSpeak protocol(https://www.multispeak.org/). MS-SPEAK also provides tools to demonstrate cyber security for the remote metering connect/disconnect function in MultiSpeak, which should encourage users and vendors to implement cyber security for other MultiSpeak functional interfaces.
